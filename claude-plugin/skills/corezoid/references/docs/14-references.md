To Us. All and any notices to Us shall be addressed by electronic mail to: support@corezoid.com.(c) Language. All communications and notices to be made or given pursuant to this Agreement must be in the English language.

Support Statement. We will support customers who run Corezoid Actor Engine products on supported Operating Systems, irrespective of whether they are running in VMware environments or not. We support Operating Systems, not specific hardware configurations. Accordingly, VMware operates as a hardware abstraction layer. VMware supports a set of certified Operating Systems and Hardware, and the customer and VMware will be responsible for any interactions or issues that arise at the Hardware or Operating System layer as a result of their use of VMware.
We will not require You to recreate and troubleshoot every issue in a non-VMware environment; however, We do reserve the right to request You to diagnose certain issues in a native certified Operating System environment, operating without the virtual environment. We will only make this request when there is reason to believe that the virtual environment is a contributing factor to the issue.

Any time spent on investigation of problems that may, in our sole opinion, be related to VMware, will be handled in the following fashion:

We will provide standard support to all Corezoid Actor Engine products.

If a problem is encountered while Corezoid Actor Engine is/are running in a VMware environment, You may be required to recreate the problem on a non-VMware server unit, at which time we will provide regular support.

You can authorize Us to investigate the VMware-related items at normal time and materials rates. If such investigation shows that the problem is VMware related, You may contract Us to provide a software change to resolve the issue if such a resolution is possible.

Regardless of the problem type or source, if the problem is determined to be a non-VMware-related issue - time spent on investigation and resolution will be covered as part of regular maintenance, and support will be provided as usual.

Amazon Linux 2 is a supported OS for Corezoid Actor Engine. You will receive the same support on Amazon Linux 2 as they would on any other certified operating system.

### 9.5 Send Notification Emails

### List of Corezoid events for which notification emails are sent
There are seven types of system messages in Corezoid:

Password recovery

Registration confirmation

Invite a user to a company

Object sharing

Changing a user's password

Object download

Task download

Task upload error

After installing the system, you need to create and configure a process that sends these system messages or only some of them.

Depending on the action, an object with different parameters is sent to the process, among them there will always be two mandatory parameters:

type - email type

recipients : [{email}] - users’ emails for mailing

Optional parameter:

lang - user language - depending on it, you can prepare email templates in different languages. If a user has not selected a language, the default value will be lang = en.


### Process example
Add the Condition node after the Start node.

In the Condition node, configure branching conditions for sending two types of messages: Invite a user to a company (type = invite) and Object sharing (type = share).

Add the API Call node for every message type.
Example of API Call node configuration.

Add an array processing sequence if an email has to be sent to multiple users:

After the Condition node, add the Code node that will process the array of emails and decrease it each time a task is passed through this node. Paste the following code into the code editor (language: JavaScript):
if (data.index == undefined) {

data.index = 0;

} else {

data.index = data.index + 1;

}

data.length_recipients = data.recipients.length - 1;
data.email = data.recipients[data.index].email;

Connect the Code node to the API Call node.

After the API Call node, add another Condition node to check the length of the array.

d. Connect the API Call node (2.2) to the Condition node (4).

Separate the sequence of sending emails that notify on downloading various objects and make object-specific texts for them: Add additional constituent conditions to node 1, and add the following nodes to the process: 2.3, 1.4, 2.4:

You can supplement the process with individual sequence of nodes necessary for sending emails.


### Adding Process ID to settings
After completing the process configuration, add the process ID to the capi_user_notify_conv setting of the Superadministrator menu, Settings section. To do that:

In the upper-right corner of the page, click your profile image, and in the dropdown list, select Superadmin.

On the Settings tab, enter the process ID in the capi_user_notify_conv field.


### 9.6 Notifying users on process blockin/deblocking

### Overview
After installing the Corezoid, you need to create and configure a process that sends notifications on processes blocking/unblocking

Block/unblock users

The feature to block/unblock users is available only for super admins. A notification can be sent to an affected Process owner or another person.

An object with the following parameters is sent to the Process:

blocked_reason - reason for blocking specified by a superadmin

action - action type, possible values:

block_process

unblock_process

user_id - identifier of a superadmin which blocked/unblocked the process

login - login of a superadmin which blocked/unblocked the process

obj = conv (default)

obj_id - process identifier

process_owner - process owner login (email)

process_owner_id - process owner identifier

lang - process owner language

Use these parameters for creating a notification email body, subject, recipient.


### Process example
Add the Set Parameters node after the Start node. This step allows a notification email to open the process directly using this link.
Note: For creating a process link this step is optional.

After the Set Parameters node, add the Condition node where configure branching conditions for sending two types of messages: process block and unblock.

Add API Call nodes for each message type and connect the API Call nodes to the Condition node:
Example of the API Call node configuration.

You can add an individual sequence of nodes for sending other emails to the process.


### Adding Process ID to settings
After completing the process configuration, add the process ID to the capi_block_unblock_notify_conv setting of the Superadministrator menu, Settings section. To do that:

In the upper-right corner of the page, click your profile image, and in the dropdown list, select Superadmin.

On the Settings tab, enter the process ID in the capi_block_unblock_notify_conv field.

Company ID: A unique identifier for organizations using Corezoid.

Condition Node: The node that creates a condition using the specified parameters and routes tasks in your workflow based on the condition.

Conveyor: A collection of tasks waiting to be processed in Corezoid. It is used in nodes to track the status of task processing.

Counter: represents values without any associated actions; it can be system-level or user-defined.

Counters: Provide statistics on tasks that entered a final (End) node.

Corezoid API is the interface that allows developers to interact with Corezoid using a request-response scheme. With the Corezoid API, you can integrate Corezoid's capabilities into your applications, platforms, or systems, adding new features.

D

Dashboard: A customizable interface for monitoring and visualizing Processes and metrics.

Database: In Corezoid, it is a connection between the actual database and a Process where you use the Database Call node.

Delay Node: A node that pauses task execution for a specified amount of time.

Direct URL: A unique link for sending tasks directly to Processes or State Diagrams.

E

End Node: A terminal node in a Process that signifies task completion.

F

Folder: A structure within Corezoid for organizing Processes, Dashboards, and diagrams.

Function: An operation that needs to be performed on the object from the queue in a node. Functions can be added as an API, program code, another Process, and so on.

### 12.3 API Reference
Corezoid public Open API lets you automate everything you can do in the Corezoid UI — create, modify and query tasks, processes, dashboards, folders, users and other objects. It is versioned (/api/1/… and the newer /api/2/…) and JSON-based. Each call is a single POST that carries an ops[] array of operations (for example type:"create", obj:"task", conv_id:"1234"), allowing you to batch many actions in one request.

Authentication is signature-based rather than token-based: you combine timestamp + secret + payload (SHA-1/MD5 in v1, SHA-256 in v2) to produce the SIGNATURE, and build the URL:

https://api.corezoid.com/api/{version}/json/{api_login}/{timestamp}/{signature}

which the server validates before executing your ops.

The spec has more than 70 endpoints grouped into logical resources such as task, conv (Process), folder, dashboard, user, history, stat, file upload/download/compare/merge, and admin functions. The Open API 2.0 page lists every path, its input schema and sample 200/4xx responses.

The v2 namespace adds multipart upload, object versioning and richer responses while deprecating some v1 fields (e.g., project_id removed from list:history).

### 12.7 Configuration Notes
Corezoid Superadmin

General Info

Corezoid Superadmin is an application designed for Corezoid instance administrators. It allows configuring certain system parameters through the interface instead of the configuration file. With Corezoid Superadmin, administrators can view the current versions of application components and their change history. Additionally, it enables administrators to log in as another user and manage the license file.

System Settings section

On the Components Versions page, you can see a list of installed components in the Corezoid application along with their version history, including the current version:

Screenshot 412: Superadmin panel.

The Copy versions button allows you to copy the entire version history. This data is necessary for the Middleware team when analyzing bug reports and incidents.

You can also delete old component version history records by following these steps:

Select the records you want to delete;

Click the Delete button that appears at the top of the table, next to the Copy versions button;

In the pop-up window, click the I understand all risks button.

Settings

On the System Settings page, you will find a list of system parameters that can be modified on the fly without updating the configuration file or reloading the application.

Screenshot 413: Superadmin panel: Settings.

To apply a new value to a parameter:

Find the desired parameter in the list;

Modify the parameter value in the corresponding field;

Click the Commit button to the right.

You can also view the history of parameter value changes, including who (UserInfo), when (TimeStamp), and how (Value) the changes were made. The change history can be accessed in the side menu by clicking on the history button under each parameter name:

### 12.11 Corezoid SDK
The Corezoid SDK is a lightweight, open-source client library (available in PHP, Java, Python, Go, Erlang) that wraps Corezoid’s REST endpoints so developers can queue, add, modify or query “tasks” in a Corezoid process with just a few method calls; it automatically builds the signed URLs required by the platform, handles JSON serialization, retries and error parsing, and exposes convenience helpers (ping, bulk upload, token refresh, log download) while staying dependency-free and compatible with everything from legacy PHP 5.3 to modern PHP 8, making it the fastest way to embed Corezoid’s event-driven workflow engine into any backend or microservice.


You can find Corezoid SDKs in different programming languages and the associated documentation on the Corezoid Git repository.

Corezoid PHP SDK

Corezoid.php is the single class that implements the entire Corezoid PHP SDK.

It wraps Corezoid’s REST API (upload/modify tasks, ping, sign‑check) and hides the details of URL signing, cURL calls and JSON handling so that you can push data to Corezoid with a few lines of code.
