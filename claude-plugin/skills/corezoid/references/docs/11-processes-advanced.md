## 5. Corezoid Processes Guide

### 5.1 Building Processes
Corezoid Processes are constructed by adding and connecting nodes. To build a Process:

In Corezoid, open the Workspace tab.

Click Create and select Process.

Enter the Process name and click OK.

In the Process, add nodes by dragging them into the canvas from the toolbar.

Connect nodes by dragging lines between them to establish transitions.

Configure each node’s properties (e.g., parameters, conditions, payload).

Screenshot 349: Creating a Process.

Working with Task Parameters

To access task parameters, open a Process and click the  icon in the upper right corner:

Task Management Features

Task Viewing: Allows you to monitor tasks as they flow through a Process, displayed in either a JSON or table format.
How to find:

Open a Process in Editor and click the View tab.

Click the final node where you want to view a task.

Click the Statistics tab to view the task processing graph showing the total number of processed tasks, current queue size, and execution times, or the Archive tab to view the task content and parameters. Task info is updated in real-time.

Use the range selection on the Statistics tab to view the chart for a specific period. On the Archive tab, use the menu icons to export the task to a CSV file, view the selected node info, set scroll, make tasks view include or exclude System Parameters, and reset the node input tasks counter.

To include or exclude System Parameters (task processing status, user ID of the task owner, and previous node ID) in the task info, on the Archive tab, click the three-dot menu and select or deselect System Parameters.

Debugging: Helps identify and resolve issues by pinpointing tasks that failed at specific nodes.
How to find:

Open a Process and click the View tab.

Click the final node where you want to view a failed task.

Click the Archive tab to view the task error info.

For more details on debugging, see Debugging a Process.

You can configure task parameters in the window:

Screenshot 354: Input tab.

Task parameters define the structure and content of data flowing through the Process:

Input Parameters:

Received by the Start Node at Process initiation.

Example: {"user_id": 12345, "email": "user@example.com"}.

Local Parameters:

Temporary variables used within the Process for calculations or intermediate logic.

Output Parameters:

Generated by the Process and available to external systems via the Reply Node or API.

Best Practices:

Limit active tasks to 100,000 per Process for optimal performance.

Use unique parameter names across all Processes to avoid conflicts.

For more details, see Task parameters.


### 5.2 Debugging a Process
You can debug a Process to see the details of each stage and to make sure all the internal stages work properly. To do so:

Open your Process, click the expand icon next to the status name, from the dropdown list, select Debug, and then on the upper panel, click Debug.

Screenshot 355: Process debug.

In the New Task dialog of the Debug mode, enter task parameters, and then click Add task.
Screenshot 356: Process debug-add task.

After the message “Task was sent” appears, click the Forward button .

Screenshot 357: Task forward button.

You can see the first stage of your task in the Process, and the details appear on the Result of the execution of the last tact panel.

Screenshot 358: Result of the execution of the last tact.

Task parameters can be edited directly in the debugging process.

Every time you click the Forward button , the next stage details appear on the right panel, and you can check if it works properly step by step. You can also use other buttons on the upper panel:

Repeat button: To repeat the needed stage.

Play button: To play the whole Process.

Back button: To go one step back.

You can modify the Process debugging by adding:

Add breakpoint button: To add the final point to the needed place in a Process.

Screenshot 359: Add breakpoint button.

Add start point button: To add the start point to the needed place in a Process.

Screenshot 360: Add start point button.

To remove the breakpoint or start point, click it and press the Delete button on your keyboard.

Below, you can see an example of debugging a Process with delay.

## 6. Advanced Features
API Integration and Sync API

Corezoid supports API integration for real-time interactions. Key differences between Corezoid API and Sync API:

Corezoid API:

Used for asynchronous task submission.

Suited for bulk task processing and long-running workflows.

Responses are retrieved later using task IDs.

Sync API:

Enables immediate response for a submitted task.

Ideal for real-time use cases like chatbots or quick data retrieval.

API Gateway

The API Gateway provides advanced routing and task submission features:

Load Balancing: Distribute requests across multiple Corezoid instances.

Security: Add authentication layers (e.g., OAuth, API keys).

Transformation: Pre-process incoming data (e.g., JSON-to-XML conversion).

Example Use:

Use API Gateway to accept incoming webhooks from third-party services and route them into Corezoid workflows.

Customizing Notifications

Configure multilingual templates for notifications.

Add placeholders to dynamically include user-specific data.

Email notification template editor with dynamic fields.

Real-Time Dashboard Creation

Dashboards in Corezoid display live metrics:

Open the Dashboard tab.

Drag widgets (e.g., charts, tables) onto the canvas.

Bind widgets to Process parameters or database queries.

A dashboard showing live task metrics and API response times.

Advanced Automations and Conditional Logic

Use nested Condition Nodes to implement complex decision trees.

Automate workflows by integrating with external CRMs or marketing tools.

Security Features and Role-Based Access Control

Assign roles and permissions to team members.

Use audit logs to track changes in Processes.
