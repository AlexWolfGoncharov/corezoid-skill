# Corezoid Playbooks

Step-by-step implementation playbooks for common process scenarios.

## Purpose

- Turn requirements into deterministic build steps.
- Reduce ambiguity before editing process nodes and logics.
- Standardize validation and handoff quality.

## Suggested Usage

1. Select a matching flow pattern.
2. Map required inputs/outputs and error branches.
3. Implement nodes in sequence.
4. Validate against `references/json-schema/` and API constraints.
