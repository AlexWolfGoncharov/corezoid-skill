# Corezoid Samples

Reference implementations with practical payloads and node patterns.

## Purpose

- Reuse proven patterns for API calls, routing, and error handling.
- Compare expected parameter shapes before building custom logic.
- Reduce trial-and-error for complex flows.

## Suggested Usage

1. Find the closest sample by flow type.
2. Reuse structure, not hardcoded identifiers.
3. Adapt node naming, refs, and endpoints to your workspace.
4. Validate resulting process with schema and test task runs.
